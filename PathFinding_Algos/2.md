## Introduction

Motion planning is the nervous system of autonomous systems. It helps in finding an obstruction-free path from a start point to a goal, using various mathematical calculations and algorithms. These algorithms essentially show different approaches to balance optimality, computation time, memory usage, and adaptability to dynamic environments.

## Algorithms Overview

### 1. A\* Algorithm

#### Strengths:

- It provides the shortest path.
- Trial and error driven making it extremely efficient in large spaces.
- Optimal and whole for static environments.

#### Weaknesses:

- Becomes slow in very large or dynamic environments.
- Huge amount of memory usage for large grids.

#### Applicability:

- Perfect for 2D pathfinding in grid-based schemes like game maps, and navigation in static environments.

### 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm

#### Strengths:

- Ensures the fastest path for weighted graphs.
- Easy to use and suitable for incidental graphs.

#### Weaknesses:

- It tends to be slow, as it explores all nodes equally without possible trials and errors.
- Ineffective for large environments in comparison to A\*.

#### Applicability:

- It is used in graph traversal where all edges have different costs. Usually used for simple environments without the need for a heuristic.

### 3. RRT (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree)

#### Strengths:

- Efficient in high-dimensional spaces.
- It handles dynamic and complex environments well.
- Has a good speed for initial feasible pathfinding.

#### Weaknesses:

- It might not provide the shortest or the best path.
- Paths tend to be abrupt and require post-processing.

#### Applicability:

- Suitable for robot path planning in high-dimensional spaces (e.g., robotic arms) and dynamic environments.

### 4. PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap)

#### Strengths:

- Has good efficiency for high-dimensional structure spaces.
- It can calculate paths beforehand in fixed environments for fast online queries.

#### Weaknesses:

- It is not proper for dynamic environments.
- It requires a large number of instances to ensure scope.

#### Applicability:

- It is best for robotic systems where precomputation is possible, such as manipulators in known environments.

### 5. RRT\*

#### Strengths:

- It is the advanced version of RRT that converges to an optimal solution.
- It tends to balance exploration and optimization over time.

#### Weaknesses:

- It is slower than standard RRT because of optimization.
- More complex to implement.

#### Applicability:

- Suitable for environments where both viable routes and optimization are necessary, such as autonomous vehicle navigation.

### 6. D\* Lite

#### Strengths:

- It is specially made for dynamic environments.
- It replans efficiently upon obstacles' dynamicity.

#### Weaknesses:

- It can be slower than A\* in static environments.

#### Applicability:

- Ideal for systems that operate in environments with dynamic obstacles or changing configurations (e.g., real-time robot navigation).

### 7. Potential Field Method

#### Strengths:

- Straightforward and instinctive.
- Operates in real-time with low calculational overhead.

#### Weaknesses:

- Can get stuck in local minima.
- May struggle with narrow routes or elaborate environments.

#### Applicability:

- Suitable for local obstacle avoidance and simple reactive navigation.


### Implementation of RRT
So basically during the Implementation of RRT, we have functions which are generating random points within the boundary points and finding the nearest point near the nodes. Also we have a function which is through some geometrical algebra, looks into non-collision of object with the path of autonomous system. After some trials and errors we reach the nearest point to our goal, and then tracing the path backwards, we find an optimum path for the autonomous system. This can be seen in the code implemented.


## Conclusion

Selecting the right motion planning algorithm depends on the specific needs of your application. A* and Dijkstra's are best for optimal pathfinding in static environments, while RRT, RRT*, and D\* Lite offer flexibility in dynamic and high-dimensional spaces. PRM and Potential Field methods are more niche but useful in specific scenarios.
